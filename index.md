# Bhushan K. Bonde

Principal Group leader in AI/ML & computational biology. I build scalable scientific platforms and models that accelerate drug discovery, combining systems biology, rewrite translational bioinformatics algorithms to make them use for better needs, and pragmatic engineering (Containers on HPC/GPU, Kubernetes, cloud).

## Featured projects

### UCB scientific container platform
- **Impact:** 10+ bioinformatics/AI apps in production from code to lab; **annual savings 300–500K**.
- **Stack:** Docker, Kubernetes, Azure/AWS, CI/CD, Linux HPC.
- **Outcome:** Standardized dev-to-prod workflows, reproducibility, rapid onboarding.

### DeepCDR: Antibody design
- **Approach:** Sequence + binding data; deep learning for CDR optimization.
- **Result:** Candidate ranking and design support in discovery cycles.

### SynthBot: Retrosynthesis
- **Method:** Graph/ML-based retrosynthesis planning for small molecules.
- **Value:** Faster route exploration; decision support for chemistry.

### D2P2: Toxicity prediction
- **Data:** 20 years of Computational Biology; privacy-preserving ML and AL, GenAI stacks.
- **Deliverable:** Early risk flags integrated into discovery workflows.

### Knowledge Graphs and Lakes: Biological graph DB
- **Scope:** Genes, proteins, pathways, diseases, drugs, ENCODE, biomarkers.
- **Benefit:** Fast cross-dataset queries; hypothesis generation.
